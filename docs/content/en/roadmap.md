## Roadmap

If you have any ideas for optimization of `vue-final-modal`, feel free to open issues.

These are the features that will be added in the comming weeks:

- draggable modal
- resizable
- duplicate overlay property
- dynamic emit modal component with vue directive like:
  - `this.$modal.show('hello-world')`
  - `this.$modal.hide('hello-world')`
